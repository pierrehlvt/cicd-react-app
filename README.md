# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# DEPLOY TO SERVER WITH GITHUB ACTIONS
### `github-actions-deploy.yaml`
This file allow to deploy the build on a distant server on push on main branch

First, you need to create repository secrets.
To do this you need to go to : 
### `Repository setting` -> `Secrets` -> `Actions` -> `New Repository secret`

Now you need create `HOST`, `PORT`, `USERNAME`, `PRIVATE_KEY` and `PASSPHRASE` secrets.

After this, you can push on main and workflow will deploy your build on your server.
For more information check the `github-actions-deploy.yaml` comments.

# DOCKER

To build a docker container of this app, run these commands : 

`docker build -t your-image-name .` This command allow to build a Docker image from the Dockerfile

This command allow to create a container from the image built before, 3000 is the container's port, you need to add the port you want on your localhost, for example we set on port 3001 below, but you can set the port that you want
`docker run -p local-port-you-want:3001 your-image-name`

Congratulations, you can now access your app on http://localhost:3001
